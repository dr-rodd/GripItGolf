# Pending concepts

Ideas Ross has agreed are good but has not asked to be built yet. Each is
kept here whole enough to be picked up cold by a later session: what it is,
why it came up, what it would touch, and the questions to settle first.
When one is built, move its decisions into the doc that owns that area and
delete it from here.

## Golfer of the Year for clubs

**Where it came from.** The November 2026 session on the tournament create
flow (Ross, 8 Nov): a series covers a society's season or a club's Golfer
of the Year, and a club product would want the second built for it.

**What it is.** If Green Dot is ever a product for clubs, link the club's
competitions for the year as a series, the organiser marking each
competition eligible or ineligible, so a Golfer of the Year standing builds
itself from the eligible ones.

**What it builds on.** The series (`LeagueSetup.repeat`, ad hoc rounds, a
round that does not count via `rounds.casual`) and Golf Ireland's cards
filed to rounds by date and venue (`roundForCard` in
`lib/golfIrelandCards.ts`).

**Questions first.** How a club's competition list arrives (Golf Ireland,
or entered by hand); whether eligibility is per competition or by rule (all
medals, no opens); points by position or Stableford totals.

## Handicap cuts between rounds

**Where it came from.** The winter league (`docs/event-use-cases.md`, use
case 1). Ross's note asked to "change handicap increment for individual
days"; the per-round setting turned out to be the handicap *allowance*
(stage 3's gear), and a *cut* was agreed to be a good idea of its own,
October 2026.

**What it is.** A winter league's own adjustment of a player's handicap
after a result, the way club and society leagues keep the same winners
from winning every week: the winner of a round plays the next one off, say,
two shots less, the runner-up one shot less. Some leagues restore the cut
after a run of rounds without a placing, or cap the total cut.

**Why it is not an allowance.** An allowance is a percentage applied when a
board reads the cards, never stored (`lib/handicapAllowance.ts`). A cut is
a fact about a player that carries forward from one round to the next and
depends on results, so it changes what the *next* round's card is scored
off. It sits between the handicap index and the board.

**What it would touch.**

- Where the cut lives. Probably per player per round, beside the
  `round_handicaps` snapshot, or as a league-level adjustment the snapshot
  is computed from. Never by overwriting `players.handicap`, which is the
  player's real index and is shared with every other screen.
- When it is applied. After a round is final (its cards committed), the
  next round's snapshots are re-written with the cut in. A round already
  started must not have its handicaps moved under it
  (`docs/gotchas-and-debt.md` on mid-round snapshots).
- The Stableford trigger and the canonical formula are untouched: a cut
  changes the handicap fed in, not the maths.
- The organiser's rules: how many shots for 1st, 2nd, 3rd; whether cuts
  accumulate; a cap; whether a cut is ever restored; whether a round that
  does not count (stage 2) can cut.
- Saying it on screen: the player's card and the board should show "off
  12 (−2 cut)" so nobody thinks the handicap was mistyped.

**Questions to settle first.** The cut table and cap; whether a cut is
per league or follows the player into other events (almost certainly per
league); whether Golf Ireland cards in a mixed league are cut too, given
their Stableford is Golf Ireland's official figure and cannot be re-scored.

## Checking courses and scorecards that players add

Ross, 11 Nov 2026: agreed as a future project, not to be built yet.

**The idea.** Anyone can add a course from a course picker, and anyone who may start a card can photograph its scorecard (D68–D71). Those courses and cards are shared by every event on the platform, so one bad card is bad for everyone. Every course and scorecard a player adds should be recorded internally against whoever added it, and a review system should check them.

**What already exists.** Courses, holes and tees are written only by the server (migration 040). `card_verified` records that a photo confirmed a card. `/admin/courses` lists every course by card state and edits names, counties and tees. Nothing records **who** added a course or a photo, or from which event.

**What it needs.**
- **An audit record.** Each added course and each applied card check, with who (the phone's anonymous user id from row-level security stage 1), which event, when, and what changed (the photo's diff). It must be server only, with RLS on and no phone grant.
- **A review queue in `/admin`.** New courses and photo corrections are waiting to be looked at. Each can be accepted, corrected, or rolled back to the card before the change.
- **Rules worth checking automatically.** A new course whose name is very close to an existing one. A photo correction that moves pars rather than indexes. Several corrections to one course from different events.

**Open questions.** Whether a correction should go live at once, as it does now, or wait for review on a course other events are already using. How long the record is kept, and what the privacy notice says about it. Whether an organiser can see who changed a course their event plays.
